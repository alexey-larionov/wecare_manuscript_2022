# Calculate effective numbers for different counts of cases and controls (as recommended in the manuscript)
n_eff <- 4 / (1/cases_num + 1/controls_num)

# Prepare the data files (wes.txt and ampliseq.txt) and script (metal.txt)

# Go to the folder with script (metal.txt) and data files (wes.txt and ampliseq.txt)
cd /Users/alexey/Documents/wecare/reanalysis_2022/metaanalysis

# Run analysis (assuming that metal tool is installed)
metal metal.txt &> metal.log

# The results are in
METAANALYSIS1.TBL
