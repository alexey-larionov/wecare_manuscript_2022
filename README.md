# Scripts for WECARE manuscript

The source fastq files were generated by CRUK Cambridge Institute Genetic core in 2014-2015 using HiSeq Illumina machines and 125-150PE Nextera WES library prep kits.  

The scripts were used for WECARE analysis in 2015-2022.  Computationally demanding steps were performed using Cambridge University HPC.

For clarity, the provided scripts do not include  

- concordance checks with GWAS data  
- processing Non-Finnish Female Europeans from FASTQ to gVCF (done by EF and involves publicly available 1KGP data only)  

The conceptual approach to analysis was outlined in this lecture:
